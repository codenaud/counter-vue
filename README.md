[![Counter Vue Project Image Screenshots](assets/git-screenshot01.png)](https://vue-project-contador.netlify.app/)

## Description

The Vue.js Counter project offers a simple yet effective solution for tracking and managing numbers interactively. With an intuitive user interface and responsive design, this project allows users to perform the following actions:

Increase and Decrease Count: Users can increment or decrement the count using the "+" and "-" buttons.

Reset Count: The "Reset" button sets the count back to zero, providing a quick way to start over.

Add to Unique Numbers: The "Add to Unique Numbers" button appends the current count to an array of unique numbers. If the number is already in the list, the button becomes disabled to prevent duplicate entries.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling, and Vue.js for managing the interactive elements. It provides a user-friendly experience for counting and tracking unique numbers, making it a versatile tool for various applications.
